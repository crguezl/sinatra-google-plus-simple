==============================================

Code based in the article by SATISH TALIM on SEPTEMBER 20, 2011

[Article in http://rubylearning.com](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2011/09/20/how-do-i-use-sinatra-to-access-the-google-api/)

This was an attempt to follow the aforementioned article by Satish Salim.
Have to change some code, since the API changed from when the article was written.

* The user Google+ ID and the Google API key go in the file `config.yml`.
